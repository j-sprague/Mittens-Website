# Mittens-Website

Website that randomly displays a picture of one of my cats. Each page is just one line of JavaScript which generates a random number which determines what image is displayed. Could be easily repurposed for other kinds of pictures if someone would want to try doing that.

Same as the main index.html page, but you can set the page to auto-refresh every certain number of seconds.

## converter.py

This is a python script I created to make the importing of images easier since it automatically dumps them to the folder and names them according to the numbers. This script is not necessary for the website itself.
